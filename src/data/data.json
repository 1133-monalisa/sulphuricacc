      "question": "In the contact process, SO₃ vapors are absorbed in concentrated H₂SO₄ and not in water to obtain H₂SO₄. Why?",
      "answer": "If SO₃ is directly absorbed in water, it forms a highly exothermic reaction, producing a fine mist of sulfuric acid. This mist is difficult to condense and handle, creating environmental and  hazardious pollutants ",
