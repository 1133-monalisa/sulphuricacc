      "question": "What is the Contact Process?",
      "answer": "The Contact Process is an industrial method for producing sulfuric acid. It involves the catalytic oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) to sulfur trioxide (SO₃), which is then absorbed in water to form H₂SO₄. It’s widely used because it’s efficient and produces high-purity acid",

      "question": "Why is it called the Contact Process?",
      "answer": "The name comes from the “contact” between the reactant gases (SO₂ and O₂) and the solid catalyst surface, where the reaction occurs.",

      "question": "How does pressure affect the Contact Process?",
      "answer": "Even though higher pressure favors SO₃ production, only 2 atm is used because higher pressures would make the process too expensive.",
